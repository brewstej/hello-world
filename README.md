I'm Jamie Brewster, a PhD student in Ecology at Edge Hill University in the market town of Ormskirk in the North West of England (near Liverpool!).

I started in February 2023 and I'm focusing on using spiders to measure the impact of agricultural management change in the Lowther valley, near Penrith.  Changes are seeing a transition from traditionally sheep grazed pasture to conservation grazing with Longhorn Cattle and the establishment of wood-pasture. 

In 15 years time, this will look like a mixed system of open rough grassland and wooded patches with animals roaming free.  For now, it is a series of compartments exclosed to grazing animals.  My studies are therefore looking at changes resulting in a relaxing of grazing pressure and, in some cases, cessation.

Various chapters of my work with look at taxonomic and functional diversity along with web identification and measuring.  I'm also keen to explore Terrestrial Laser Scanning approaches for recording vegetation structure to compare against traditional methods.

This should all contribute to furthering the knowledge and evidence-base for conservation efforts and ari-environment schemes in the UK.
